# Setup

## Mockoon

This acts as a live API server on `localhost:3001` (port can be configured).

1. Install Mockoon from [here](https://mockoon.com/).
2. (Optional) Install Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/).
3. Inside Mockoon, click `Open environment` and select the file `/mockoon/QuestionService.json`
4. Once your environment is created, you should see the available routes. You can further configure this, but be sure to commit to the repository so others get the update.
5. Run your environment by clicking the green play button.
6. Make a call to Mockoon either from the app (e.g. via Axios), or from Postman.

## React Project

This is a React + Vite + TypeScript project, scaffolded using `npx create vite@latest`

Set your terminal's active directory to the root of this project and enter:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
